         <h2 class="line"><a name="0"></a>What's an analyzer report?</h2>
         <p>An <b>analyzer report</b> is a collection of <b>fields</b> and <b>filters</b> that is displayed in a specific <b>report format</b>. You can think of a report as a file (like an Excel file), except that when you open a report or make a change, the report connects to your database so it displays the latest data. Reports are stored in the Pentaho solution repository, so you can access reports from any computer.</p>
         <p>When you create a new analyzer report from the ground up, you select a <b>cube</b> first. This choice determines which fields will be available when you build your report. For example, if you choose <strong>orders</strong> as your analysis area, you most likely will see all fields related to orders.</p>
         <h2 class="line"><a name="1"></a>Where does the data come from?</h2>
         <p>Pentaho Data Integration can load data from applications, databases, and spreadsheets within your company, as well as from external and public data sources. This is managed by your administrator. See <a href="the_big_picture.html">The Big Picture</a>.
         <p>You can easily view the description of a specific field. See <a href="working_with_fields.html#viewing_the_definition_of_a_field">Viewing the Definition of a Field</a>.
         <h2 class="line"><a name="2"></a>A look at the view report page</h2>
         <p>With Pentaho Analyzer, you build your report and view the results using the same web page, which has three main sections:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>The <strong>available fields area</strong> (right) shows all fields you can choose to move into the report or use to filter the report. </li>
           <li>The actual report itself (table report or chart) where the selected fields are shown. </li>
           <li><strong>The filter area</strong> holds all filters used. </li>
         </ul>
		 <h2 class="line"><a name="3"></a>Getting the report you want</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Check to see if you can <a href="viewing_a_report.html">find an existing report</a> that answers your question or that you can use as a starting point.</li>
			<li>If you don't locate an existing report, <a href="creating_a_new_report.html">create a new report</a>.</li>
			<li>Add <a href="working_with_fields.html">fields</a> and/or <a href="working_with_filters.html">filters</a> to your report to narrow down the data (e.g. <em>Year = 2004</em>).</li>
			<li>Create <a href="working_with_calculations.html">calculations</a>, such as ratios or percentages, if needed.</li>
<li>Once you have the data you need, you might want to <a href="working_with_report_formats.html">switch the format</a> of the report to a line or bar chart.</li>
<li>Save the report.</li>
<li><a href="exporting_reports.html">Print</a> a PDF version of the report for your meeting, if needed.</li></ol>
<p>After this warm-up, you should be ready to play around with <a href="setting_report_preferences.html">report options</a> or start creating <a href="creating_reports_for_others.html">reports for use by others</a>.</p>
