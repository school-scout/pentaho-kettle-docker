         <h2 class="line"><a name="0"></a>Secure Login</h2>
         <p>Your administrator will provide you with a user name and password. If you forget your password, please contact your administrator. (S)he can e-mail your password hint to you.
		 <p><strong>Note:</strong> After multiple unsuccessful attempts to log in (currently 5), you will be locked out of the Pentaho system.</p>
         <h2 class="line"><a name="changing_password" id="changing_password"></a>Changing Password </h2>
         <p>To change your password, select the <strong>My Profile</strong> link in the header section in the upper right corner.</p>
         <h2 class="line"><a name="1"></a>Access to Folders and Reports</h2>
         <p>As a user, you always have access to your own personal folder, with the same name as your user name, where you can save your reports. When you save a report using the <strong>Save</strong> dialog box, your personal folder will appear . On the <strong>Report Home</strong> page, the reports in your personal folder will appear under <b>My Reports</b>.
         <p>In addition, your administrator can provide you with access to one or many <b>Shared</b> folders. (You can then see all the reports in these folders.) Your administrator will determine what level of access you will have for each folder. There are three access options:</p>
         <ul>
            <li><b>No Access</b> to the folder. You cannot see this folder.</li>
            <li><b>View</b> all reports in the folder. You can open and view reports in this folder, but you cannot save reports into this folder or delete existing reports. You can, of course, save a version of the report in your personal folder using the <b>Save As</b> command.</li>
            <li><b>Edit</b> all reports in the folder. You can modify or delete existing reports, as well as add new reports.</li>
         </ul>
         <p><strong>Note:</strong> Only an administrator can add or delete folders.</p>
		 <p>To understand which users have access to a certain folder, please contact your administrator.</p>
         <h2 class="line"><a name="product_area_access"></a>Access to Functionality (a.k.a. Product Area Access)</h2>
         <p>A user with <b>Administrator</b> permissions can interact with all functionality and areas, including the <strong>Admin</strong> interface. All other users are set up in one of the following two ways:
         <ul>
            <li><b>Report Creator</b>: These users have access to all functionality except the <strong>Admin</strong> interface. (However, they still might not have access to all folders.) For example, they can create new blank reports.</li>
            <li><b>Report Analyzer</b>: Compared to Report Creators, these users are limited as follows:
               <ul>
                  <li>They cannot create new blank reports.</li>
                  <li>They cannot edit or remove locked filters. (See <a href="../../cv/Business_User/working_with_filters.html#7">Locked Filters</a>.)</li>
                  <li>They cannot add new fields to a report. (They cannot see the <strong>Available Fields</strong> pane.)</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>Thus, users with Report Analyzer permissions will find that certain commands, links, and buttons are unavailable. The typical reason an administrator chooses to set up some users as Report Analyzers is to shield the users from data that is not relevant to them or is not suitable for their consumption.</p>
         <p>To find out how your administrator has set you up, simply go to the <strong>Home</strong> page and view the appearance of the <b>Create Report</b> button. If this button is available (not dimmed), then you have Report Creator permissions; otherwise, you have Report Analyzer permissions.</p>
         <p><strong>Note:</strong> A user with Report Creator permissions can create reports based on any data using any fields.</p>
